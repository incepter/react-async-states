First fork the project and clone it locally.
```shell
git clone <repo_url>
cd react-async-states
pnpm i -r
pnpm prepare
cd packages/react-async-states
pnpm dev
```

After working on something, make sure to add tests and that no existing test broke (`pnpm test`).

Then push and create a pull request.
