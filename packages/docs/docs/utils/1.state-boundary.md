# State Boundary

## What is this ?

State boundary is a component that allows performing all render strategies in react:

1. Render Then Fetch: Render the initial component, then fetch its data
2. Fetch As You Render: fetch data while rendering and suspend when pending and
throw when error.
3. Fetch Then Render: renders nothing until it fetches data, suppressing
the pending state.

## `StateBoundaryProps`

This component accepts the following props:

| Property       | Type                              | Default Value     | Description                                                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config`       | `MixedConfig<T, E, R, A, S>`      | `undefined`       | The same supported configuration as the `useAsyncState` hook                                        |
| `dependencies` | `any[]`                           | `[]`              | The dependencies that will be passed to `useAsyncState` hook                                        |
| `strategy`     | `RenderStrategy`                  | `RenderThenFetch` | The applied strategy                                                                                |
| `render`       | `Record<Status, React.ReactNode>` | `undefined`       | A record containing the component to render for each status                                         |
| `children`     | `React.ReactNode`                 | `null`            | children are considered as a fallback whenever the `render` property doesn't have the actual status |


Where the `RenderStrategy` enum is defined as follows:
```ts

export enum RenderStrategy {
FetchAsYouRender = 0,
FetchThenRender = 1,
RenderThenFetch = 2,
}

```

## `useCurrentState()`

This hook returns the current state in the boundary

## `useBoundary(sourceKey?: string)`

When Multiple `StateBoundary` are nested, this hook allows you to take any
state up in the tree by its `key`.

:::warning
If the `sourceKey` isn't found, this hook will throw an `Error`.
:::

This hook then calls `useSource` on the result obtained from the `config` given
to that state boundary.
